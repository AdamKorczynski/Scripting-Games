PROBLEM:

An Archival Atrocity

Dr. Scripto is in a tizzy! It seems that someone has allowed a series of application log files to pile up for around two years, and theyâ€™re starting to put the pinch on free disk space on a server. Your job is to help get the old files off to a new location.

Actually, this happened last week, too. You might as well create a tool to do the archiving.

The current set of log files are located in C:\Application\Log. There are three applications that write logs here, and each uses its own subfolder. For example, C:\Application\Log\App1, C:\Application\Log\OtherApp, and C:\Application\Log\ThisAppAlso. Within those subfolders, the filenames are random GUIDs with a .log filename extension. After they are created on disk, the files are never touched again by the applications.

SOLUTION:

Constants:
GUID Regex pattern: "^[\d|a-fA-F]{8}-[\d|a-fA-F]{4}-[\d|a-fA-F]{4}-\d|a-fA-F]{4}-\d|a-fA-F]{12}\.log$"

Variables:
BaseSourceFolder: "C:\Application\Log"
BaseDestinationFolder: "\\remote01\archive"
SubFolders: string[] { "App1", "OtherApp", "ThisAppAlso" }
Credentials: ??

Feedback:
- Base directory doesn't exist (fail)
- Don't have permission to delete file (warn)
- Don't have permission to write to destination (warn)
- App directory doesn't exist (warn)
- Number of logs deleted and from which app(on success)

Notes:
- Don't have to worry about concurrent access as this is the only app which accesses the logs.
- Two years of logs, try batching them e.g. read file names and dispatch to worker threads, batch size configurable by size (memory, not file count)
